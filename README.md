# 108trigo_2019

A first year Epitech math project done during the 2nd semester.<br>

## Description

This project has for goal to compute certain mathematical functions to [square matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_matrix).<br>

The mathematical functions asked to be covered are the followings:

* Exponential. (defined for program input as <code>EXP</code>)
* Cosine. (defined for program input as <code>COS</code>)
* Sine. (defined for program input as <code>SIN</code>)
* Hyperbolic cosine. (defined for program input as <code>COSH</code>)
* Hyperbolic sine. (defined for program input as <code>SINH</code>)
